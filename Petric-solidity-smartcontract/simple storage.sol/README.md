-with the use of brige you can get zksync sepolia

-for remix deploy contract with zksync 
-then first add plugib zksync in remix 
-after when complie give any error than you have to make folder contract and inside that contract make file of simple storage after try to deploy that will work 

-thi contract deploy on this

-in the after deploy contract blue button for showing like view and public so with that not any transction happen but when you click oragnge button with write then transction popup and confirm with metamsk or any other wallet also 


when anyone want link token of etherum sepolia than they can get from this also 
other token also you can get from here 
https://faucets.chain.link/
I've been trying to make my first transaction using the faucet recommended but every single time I try it I get a message that says native tokens require the user to hold at least one link on Ethereum Mainnet. What am I doing wrong please?

You are not doing anything wrong, Getting sepolia eth has been difficult lately. You can try this faucet https://sepolia-faucet.pk910.de/
